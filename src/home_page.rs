It's meant to be an agent simulation of environment with plants as basis of a food chain, followed by herbivorous, carnivorous and omnivorous animals. Like any environment model, it has to be a significant simplification in relation to th real world, especially since I'm working on it on my own. Nonetheless, I've managed to implement those elements so far:
